## Todo

Work in progress. Here's a rough plan:

- [x] Figure out default return value
- [x] Date as string (Ex: October 31st, 2018; Oct. 31, 2018; Oct 31 '18, Oct 31)
    - [x] Day numbers, 01-09, modifiers (st, nd, rd, th)
    - [x] Month variants
    - [x] Optional year
- [ ] Match standard local date formats (mm/dd/yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy, etc...)
    - [x] MM/DD/YYYY and MM/DD/YY
- [ ] Date ranges (from x to y, x through y)
- [ ] Day of week
- [ ] Handle formats like:
    - [x] May the 4th
    - [x] 20th of November
    - [ ] May 12th-13th, May 12th and 13th, May 12th or 13th
        - [ ] Return as matched or as ['May 12th', 'May 13th']
    - [x] May of 2018
    - [x] May 2018
    - [x] May '18
